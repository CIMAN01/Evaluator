# Evaluator 
Building Java Program 3rd Edition - Chapter 14 Stack & Queues
Case Study: Expression Evaluator
A program that performs fully-parenthesized arithmetic computations using stacks and queues.
The program is originally from Building Java Programs Third Edition Textbook, but has been improved by adding a try/catch block to handle 
illegal tokens, thereby making it more robust. Extensive comments have also been added for better understanding of the overall program. 
Also includes other minor tweaks for personal preference.
